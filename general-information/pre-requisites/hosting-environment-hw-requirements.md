Member companies should have finalized a hosting environment that supports running docker images.

This could be an on-premise server, or a cloud server such as Azure or AWS that supports running docker images.

Optionally, Member companies can choose to deploy the docker images on a Kubernetes cluster. \(To be self-managed by Member companies, komgo will not provide support with Kubernetes configurations, troubleshooting\)

The following minimum hardware/software is required per each environment \(Production, QA\):



*   One server equivalent to AWS C4-X2Large or larger
    *   8 CPU, 16 GB RAM, 1 GBPS Network Bandwidth
*   Storage equivalent to 100 GB of EBS AWS Storage
