# Counterparty Docs Screen

On the Counterparty Docs screen, users can see the list of counterparties with whom they are interacting on the platform, as dictated by the counterparty management functionality (Section 3).

Here users can click through to view the documents which the counterparty has shared to date with their company. Users can also submit a document request to the counterparty.
