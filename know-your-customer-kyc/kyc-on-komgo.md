# KYC on komgo

komgo allows banks and corporates to manage their KYC with other parties. Through komgo’s platform an organisation can send their own documents to other counterparties for KYC purposes.

komgo leverages its document management system to provide users with a way to conveniently share KYC documents on a peer-to-peer basis. This provides a single, comprehensive platform to manage documents, providing a seamless user experience for trade finance teams.

Users can manage their KYC document libraries and create templates, which can be used to ease the process of requesting a new set of documents from a counterparty.
